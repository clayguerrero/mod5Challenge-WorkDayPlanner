# Description
### This is a planner for workday hours of 9am to 5pm. You are able to add events to a timeslot and they will persist even after a refresh. The timeslots are color coded and will change with the hour!
### Grey = The timeslot has already passed.
### Red = The current hour.
### Green = A hour that hasn't passed yet.
